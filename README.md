# DE_Property_Crime
  The context of the project is to collect data for the property data as how old, how much in sales and etc with crime rate of the area which is good do understand for it there is some steps that have be to done as Data engineering part such as:
1. Modeling logical design which aspects have to be for the project
2. Design the sql design what is from the context has to be foreign key which is primary key for the datasets.
3. Collect the data from the websites and data formatted websides as data.world, data.gov and etc.
4. Confirm the City parts we want o have data on crim and on property
5. The property crime can be taken:

6. After which we have to clean data of the propert and crime
7. After merging information on City
8. Making database with sqlalchemy
   Which is the ETL or how we know as Extraction of file transformation and loading.
For the process we have to have next libraries installesd on our local machin or on colab if you work on colab
1. pip install geopy
2. pip install pandas
3. pip install numpy
4. pip install sqlalchemy
5. pip install Nominatim
Nominatim API be prepared to run on along time on the part, user_agent we can write any like it can be our names for example "Tsovinar"
Thats all the process for the ETL warhouse data engineering project.
